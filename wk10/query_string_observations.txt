1. The moment I click on the browse icon to search for the word, the word appears as a parameter in the url as /browse/{word}.
2. The word I searched was invalid so the result I got was "no results found for ksjnv".
3. The URL appeared as /browse/<script>alert(%27hello%27)</script> and the result I got was "no results found for <script>alert(%27hello%27)</script>".
4. Nothing happened.
