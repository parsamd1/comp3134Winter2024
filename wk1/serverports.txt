1. A server port is a logical construct used to uniquely identify a specific process or service on a computer network.
2. The term "server port range" typically refers to the range of port numbers available for use on a server. In the context of TCP/IP networking, valid port numbers range from 0 to 65535. 
3. The port range from 0 to 65535 represents a 16-bit value. This is because there are a total of 2^16 (or 65,536) possible port numbers in this range.
4. port 21 / port 22 / port 80 / port 443 / port 25 / port 110 / port 143 / port 3389 / port 53 / port 3306
